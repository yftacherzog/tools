# Reference: hermetic and multi-arch baseline (konflux-ci/tools)

## Konflux build (PR / main)

| Item | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Platforms | `.tekton/tools-pull-request.yaml`, `tools-push.yaml` | `linux/x86_64`, `linux/arm64` |
| Pipeline | `.tekton/build-pipeline.yaml` | Multi-platform `buildah` + OCI TA |
| Hermetic param | `build-pipeline.yaml` `hermetic` | Default `'false'` (network allowed) |
| Prefetch | `prefetch-input` | Cachi2/Hermeto JSON; empty skips prefetch |
| Registry proxy | `enable-package-registry-proxy` | Default `'true'` for prefetch |

Hermetic build = network isolation during image build plus prefetched inputs.
Today the tools image build **relies on network** in several Dockerfile steps;
the goal is to **not add** more of that without a plan.

## Known baseline debt (do not re-copy into new lines)

Documented for reviewers; fixing these is out of scope for most PRs unless the
PR targets them.

### Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`)

- `yum install` and OpenShift client `curl` use `TARGETARCH` / `OCP_ARCH` for
  `oc` — pattern to **follow** for new arch-specific binaries.
- Helm install uses pinned version with SHA-256 checksum verification and
  `TARGETARCH` mapping (live-script / single-arch issues fixed; tracked by
  Renovate). Still a network-at-build `curl` with no Cachi2 prefetch — same
  class as the `oc` client fetch.

### Python packaging

- `Pipfile` / `pyproject.toml`: PyPI deps installed at image build via pipenv
  (s2i); not vendored in-repo.

### Multi-arch in product logic

- `verify_rpms/rpm_verifier.py` and tests model multiple architectures in image
  manifests — new code here should remain arch-agnostic unless intentionally
  platform-specific with tests for each supported arch.

## Quick grep (PR diff)

Run on changed files or the PR patch:

```bash
# Hermetic / network-at-build signals
git diff origin/main...HEAD -- Dockerfile Pipfile pyproject.toml .tekton/ \
  | grep -E 'curl |wget |pip install|yum install|dnf install|prefetch|hermetic'

# Single-arch binary / assumption signals
git diff origin/main...HEAD -- Dockerfile '**/*.py' \
  | grep -E 'amd64|x86_64|arm64|aarch64|TARGETARCH|platform\.machine|uname'
```

## When a PR improves debt

Approve and optionally note:

- Adds or updates `prefetch-input` / documents Cachi2 config for new deps.
- Removes unused network fetch or deprecated module usage.
- Adds tests for `arm64` behavior when introducing arch-sensitive code.

## AGENTS.md line budget

`AGENTS.md` is capped at 300 lines in CI. Keep long inventories in this file;
link from AGENTS.md with one row in a Skills table.
